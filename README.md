#### linkedin-clone
I used Firebase v9(modular tree-shaked) for auth and firestore database is also used to store posts.
Redux is used for state management, to store the user information, to avoid unnecessary prop drilling.
I tried Vite instead of CRA for this project.
I  used sass for styling instead of css, since styling nested classes is easy.
I used Material UI for icons, and custom elements i needed.

##### Problem faced
I had to make another project for learning new firebase.
I also made projects to get a grip of redux properly.
This project is like little practical experience to make another webapp using react/svelte + firebase + some global state management library.
this webapp made me practice a lot of things.
